** What is a Data Lake?
Features:
    - Ingest strucutred and unstructured data
    - Catalogs and indexes for analysis without data movement
    - Stores, secures and protects data in unlimited scale 
    - Connects data with analytics and machien learning tools 

** Differences between Data Lake vs Data Warehouses
DL:
    - Raw:
        - > Unstructured, structured data with minimal processing: unconventional dtaa such as logs and sensor data
    - Large:
        - > Vast amounts of of data in order of petabytes, can be stored indefinitely & be transformed when in use only 
    - Undefined: 
        - > Wide variety of applications; Machine Learning , streaming analytics and AI
DW: 
    - Refined:
        - > Contain highly structured data that is clearn pre-processed and refined; specific use case like Business Intelligence 
    - Smaller:
        - > Contain less data in terabytes; must be processed before ingestion and periodic purging of data is necessary 
    - Relational:
        - > Contain historic and relational data, such as transaction systems, operations etc 


** Workflow ORchestration
- Worflow: Tasks -> Delivery
- Worflow Configuration: Order of execution, Delivery Type, Packaging 
- Workflow Orchestration (Data flow optimization): Schedule, Privacy, Restarts or Retries

    * Core Features of Workflow Orchestration:
        - Remote Execution
        - Scheduling
        - Retries
        - Caching
        - Integration with external systems (APIs, databases)
        - Ad-hoc runs
        - Parameterization
